- title: Computer Vision for Robotic Arm Control
  technologies:
    - coppeliaSim
    - Matlab
    - OpenCV
  headline: Workpiece 3D position estimation algorithm for a robotic arm
  description: >-
    This project focused on using computer vision to control a robotic arm for pick-and-place tasks. A vision pipeline was built in MATLAB that detects objects on a conveyor belt, estimates their 3D positions using stereo cameras, and guides a robot to pick them up.
    The project incorporated transfer learning using pre-trained models: YOLOv2 for object detection and DeepLab v3+ for pixel-level segmentation — both achieved over 95% accuracy. Depth estimation was done through feature matching between stereo images, with a position error of just 7.94 mm.
    The system was tested in a simulation environment, where a 6-DOF robotic arm successfully detected, picked, and placed objects at different positions — showing how computer vision can enable smart, flexible robot control.
